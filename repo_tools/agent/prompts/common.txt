## Repo Tooling Framework

This repository uses the **repokit** framework — a unified `{repo_cmd}` CLI
configured per-project via `config.yaml`. All building, testing, formatting,
and repository operations should go through it rather than being invoked
directly.

Run `{repo_cmd} --help` to discover available commands. Common operations:

- `{repo_cmd} build` — build the project
- `{repo_cmd} test` — run the test suite
- `{repo_cmd} format` — format source code

Commands resolve platform-specific variants, paths, and tokens automatically.
See `{framework_root}/README.md` for full details on configuration, token
expansion, and extending the framework with custom tools.

## Filesystem Boundary

Only the orchestrator reads and writes files under `_agent/` (plan, tickets,
workstream state). Workers and reviewers must not access `_agent/` — relay
updates to the orchestrator via the **send_message** MCP tool instead.
