## Repo Tooling Framework

This repository uses the **repokit** framework — a unified `{repo_cmd}` CLI
configured per-project via `config.yaml`. All building, testing, formatting,
and repository operations should go through it rather than being invoked
directly.

Run `{repo_cmd} --help` to discover available commands. Common operations:

- `{repo_cmd} build` — build the project
- `{repo_cmd} test` — run the test suite
- `{repo_cmd} format` — format source code

Commands resolve platform-specific variants, paths, and tokens automatically.
See `{framework_root}/README.md` for full details on configuration, token
expansion, and extending the framework with custom tools.

## General Coding Principles

- **Fail loud.** No fallback mechanisms and no error swallowing — they hide real failures. Prefer explicit errors, invariant assertions over silent recovery.
- **Less is more.** Rewrite existing components over adding new ones. Flag obsolete files for removal.
- **Desctructive Updates by default.** Unless explicitly requested, don't preserve legacy behavior or add compatibility shims just to backward compatibility.
- **Test edge cases, not plumbing.** Cover meaningful behavior; skip tests that just assert assignment or trivial argument forwarding.
- **Tests are code too.** Keep them readable and maintainable — they outlast the session that wrote them.
- **No session artifacts in code.** Avoid comments like "Removed X" or "no longer uses Y" — future readers have no context for X.
- **Think before typing.** Use extended thinking generously; reasoning is cheaper than debugging.
- **Never punt blocked commands to the user.** When a bash command is blocked by the allowlist, read the error message for the suggested alternative and try that instead. The user may not be at the computer.
